for each venue
	if latlng in sf
		section = where latlng falls in pre-determined grid
	else
		ignore


for each checkin
	if we know about venue from the above loop (i.e. if it is in sf)
		section = get the section of this venue (we figured this out above)
		hour = get the time for this checkin (in the data file)
		update frequency of visits to this section for this hour
	else
		ignore


Data Structure:

Hour
	-> Section
		-> Frequency

e.g. if we had 3 sections

	0 o'clock
		1	-> 50 checkins
		2   -> 0 checkins
		3   -> 2 checkins
	1 o'clock
		1	-> 33 checkins
		2   -> 5 checkins
		3   -> 7 checkins
	2 o'clock
		...
		...
		...
	23 o'clock
		1	-> 40 checkins
		2   -> 5 checkins
		3   -> 10 checkins
